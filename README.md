# FCDL PoC ‚Äî From Intent to Running Federated Stack üì¶üöÄ

  
>  **Status:** research proof-of-concept *from intent to implementation*

>  **Scope:** shows that a single FCDL file can be *compiled* into a runnable Flower-based federated system with node registry, simple policy,
round-based scheduling and live metrics ‚Äî all launched with one `docker compose up`.

>  **Not production‚Äêhardened.** TLS, Vault, K8s, DLT, full RBAC, etc. are  future work.

## üöÄ Quick start (local)

# clone & install
``` bash
git  clone  https://github.com/your-org/fcdl-poc.git
cd  fcdl-poc
python  -m  venv  .venv && source  .venv/bin/activate
pip  install  -e  .
```
# generate ANTLR4 artefacts
```bash
cd spec 
antlr4 -Dlanguage=Python3 -visitor -o ../compiler/fcdl  FCDL.g4 
```  

# compile FCDL ‚Üí stack

```bash 
fcdl  compile  examples/mnist_basic.fcdl  --out  dist/mnist
```

# run!
```bash
cd  dist/mnist
docker-compose  up  --build
curl  http://localhost:5000/metrics
# ‚Üí {"round":5, "acc":0.55}
```  

  
## What this PoC demonstrates

-  Separation  of  intent & implementation: mnist_basic.fcdl  declares  what  not  how; the  compiler  decides  which  runtime/template  to  stitch.

-  Data  sovereignty (code moves,  data  stays): Each  dummy  client  trains  locally; orchestrator  never  sees  raw  data.

-  Composable  architecture: Swap  the  template  folder  in  the  planner  and  regenerate  for  Kubernetes/Helm,  Airflow,  NVFlare,  etc.

  
## ‚ö†Ô∏è What it does not do (yet) üöß

| Gap | Notes  /  future-work |
|--|--|
| Security | mTLS,  JWT,  Vault,  policy-as-code. |
| Distributed  ledger  pillar | No  Fabric/EVM  integration; stubs  only.|
| Real  data  /  models | Clients  are  dummy  stubs  ‚Äî  replace  with  real  training  code.|
| Production  deployment | No  Helm  /  Terraform; compose  only.}
| IDE  /  LSP  tooling | No  syntax  highlighting  or  auto-complete (future plugin).| 
  
  
  

## üß© Extending the PoC

-  Replace  dummy  client  ‚Äî  edit  generator/flower_compose/client.py.j2  and  regenerate.
-  Add  DLT  ‚Äî  create  a  new  template  folder  flower_compose_dlt/  containing  Fabric  docker-compose & chaincode,  then  point  the  planner  at  it  when  it  sees  DistributedLedger  in  the  FCDL  file.
-  Switch  to  K8s  ‚Äî  drop  a  Helm  chart  into  generator/flower_helm/,  add  a  planner  rule  deployment_tool  =  helm,  regenerate.

## Narrative for IS seniors managers and strategists

1. Intent  ‚Üí  Stack  in  one  command
    
    > Show  `mnist_basic.fcdl` (20 lines) ‚Üí fcdl compile ‚Üí a runnable
    Compose folder.
    
    2.  Swap  runtime  without  touching  infra  teams
    
    > Change  `runtime="ray"`  ‚Üí  re-compile  ‚Üí  new  stack  with  Ray‚ÄêServe
    comes  out.
    
    3.  No  lock-in
    
    > FCDL  never  names  Docker,  Compose,  or  Flower  ‚Äì  those  are 
    compiler  choices.
    
    4.  Path  to  production (slide)
    
    > *Security  hardening*  ‚Üí  use  the  same  FCDL,  switch  to  a 
    helm_secure  template  that  bakes  in  mTLS,  Vault,  Prometheus, 
    etc.
    
	  5. Data  monetisation  concept

	> Add  a  `DistributedLedger`  module  ‚Üí  compiler  pulls  the  ‚Äúfabric_compose‚Äù  template  ‚Üí  orchestrator  logs  each  training  contribution  on-chain.  Shows  business  how  royalties  could  be  automated; not  coded  today,  but  the  slot  is  there.

# ü§ñ üöß Work in Progress Human-Machine Collaboration in Federated Compute (self-healing Agentic AI)

The FCDL PoC is not only a demonstration of federated learning orchestration ‚Äî
it embodies the future of intent-driven computing where humans and machines collaborate to manage distributed systems.

|Role |Description|
|---|----|
|Human architects |Define WHAT the system should achieve (e.g., federated learning, API exposure, DLT recording) by writing .fcdl files.
|AI Supervisor (future)| Determines HOW to implement the system ‚Äî selects runtimes, adapts templates, injects optimizations, patches deployment files |dynamically.|
|Compiler/Planner | Executes static planning today; later, will collaborate with AI agents for dynamic system generation.|
|Deployment stack | Is generated fully from intent, minimizing human error and accelerating innovation.|


>Move from hardcoded infrastructures to fluid, evolvable, AI-augmented federated systems  where changing business or research goals means simply editing .fcdl intent files, without re-engineering low-level deployments manually.

 # Vision and Roadmap üöÄ

## What We've Accomplished

The FCDL POC demonstrates a powerful approach to federated computing implementation - expressing intent in a high-level domain-specific language that compiles to runnable infrastructure. With this approach:

 1. We've successfully created a working MNIST federated learning system with just 20 lines of FCDL code
 2. The system includes role-based data nodes, a CNN model, API exposure, and federated orchestration
 3. We've demonstrated separation of intent (what the system should do) from implementation (how it does it)
 4. Our compilation pipeline transforms high-level descriptions into concrete Docker Compose deployments
 5. The implemented system maintains data sovereignty (training happens locally on nodes) while enabling global model improvement
This POC serves as validation that the FCDL approach can simplify the deployment of complex federated systems while maintaining flexibility.

## The Value Proposition

FCDL isn't just an abstraction layer; it's a domain-specific way to define data-driven business infrastructures:
 - For Data Scientists: Focus on models and algorithms without infrastructure complexity
- For Infrastructure Teams: Standardize deployments and reduce the maintenance burden
- For Business Leaders: Implement data strategies that maintain sovereignty and compliance
- For Developers: Leverage existing tools (Flower, Docker, etc.) without reinventing integration patterns

## Future Directions

While our POC has validated the core concept, several directions would enhance FCDL's practical value:

### Domain-Specific Specialization
Rather than a generic solution, FCDL can be specialized for specific domains:
- Healthcare FCDL: Pre-built templates for HIPAA compliance, medical imaging models
- Financial FCDL: Templates optimized for transaction data, regulatory reporting, fraud detection
- Retail/CPG FCDL: Customer analytics, inventory optimization, with appropriate privacy controls

  
### Infrastructure Integration

Instead of building custom templates for every deployment target, integrate with existing infrastructure tools:
- Cloud Providers: Generate Terraform/CloudFormation for AWS, Azure, GCP deployments
- Kubernetes: Output Helm charts for orchestration in container environments
- CI/CD: Create integration points with modern DevOps pipelines

  
### Enhanced Security and Compliance
Add first-class support for:
- Data Privacy: Differential privacy, homomorphic encryption options
- Auditing: Provenance tracking of model contributions
- Governance: Policy enforcement throughout the federated system

 
### AI-Assisted Template Generation
Leverage large language models to:
- Generate Templates: Create implementation templates based on intent descriptions
- Debug Assistance: Help troubleshoot deployment issues
- Code Completion: Assist with FCDL authoring

  
## Conclusion

The FCDL framework represents a practical approach to the complex challenge of federated computing deployment. By separating intent from implementation, it creates a foundation for more maintainable, adaptable federated systems.

Our MNIST POC demonstrates that this isn't just theoretical - we were able to move from concept to working implementation in a matter of hours, not weeks. With further development in domain-specific templates and infrastructure integration, FCDL has the potential to significantly accelerate federated computing adoption across industries.

The future of data-driven systems is federated, not centralized. FCDL provides a pathway to that future that respects both technical realities and business imperatives.
